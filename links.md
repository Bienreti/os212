Hello, this is my collection of articles and videos that i find interesting and helpful.

#### 1. [The unsolved math problem which could be worth a billion dollars (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8COArd_EREw)

#### 2. [Learn VIM while playing a game - VIM Adventures](https://vim-adventures.com/)

A great pixel game that simulates vim controls. By completing this game, you will know the use of b,B,e,E,w,W,x,X and be comfortable using hjkl. There are actually much more than that, but sadly, you have to pay $25. It is still worth to try though if you are going to use vim.
