## TIPS

#### 1. Spend less time to actually read the OSC book (just grasp the general idea by skimming) and spend more time on resources on the internet

Sometimes the book is too technical and hard to follow. Save your time by searching other resources on the internet. They are mostly easier to understand.

#### 2. Do all the demo and last year mid/final-term exams (don't skip it)

Not doing it will make you have a bad grade on quiz.

#### 3. Your links are very useful, try to have the best set of links

Links are crucial when you want to lookup to some concepts. You can also use links you have gotten from #1. Bam! Kill two birds with one stone.

#### 4. Actively check the course page on SCeLE

Never miss out a single information. They can affect your grade.
