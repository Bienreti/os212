## TIPS

#### 1. Spend less time to actually read the OSC book (just grasp the general idea by skimming) and spend more time on resources on the internet

Sometimes the book is too technical and hard to follow. Save your time by searching other resources on the internet. They are mostly easier to understand.

#### 2. Your links are very useful, try to have the best set of links

Links are crucial when you want to lookup to some concepts. You can also use links you have gotten from #1. Bam! Kill two birds with one stone.

#### 3. Do all the demo and last year mid/final-term exams (don't skip it)

Not doing it will make you have a bad grade on quiz.

#### 4. Actively check the course page on SCeLE

Never miss out a single information. They can affect your grade.

#### 5. If you can't get the right solution or in doubt to the MidTem problems, try this method.

First, open the MidTem problem pdf which has the name "^\d+$".pdf (some_number.pdf). Next, delete **just** the file name url. Doing that you should be directed to rms46.vlsm.org site and in a particular page. Next, find a MidTem pdf file, but with "kk" suffix. If the pdf is locked, that means you have the right pdf. Now, you can use this https://www.ilovepdf.com/unlock_pdf and unlock the pdf. That's all there into it.

#### 6. Need some more exercises? Try searching for GATE-CS problem and solution of a particular topic on the internet

GATE-CS is a test for getting into post-grad CS/IT program in top indian uni's. Fortunately, operating system come out to be one of the covered topics.

#### 7. Get yourself a beefy computer ASAP

You should know what you're heading to if the course uses VirtualBox (Hint: Lot of rams).

#### 8. Backup your virtual box image before doing some high risk assignment

Later in the course, some part of the assignment will take about 15-30 minutes. If you fail that one, you must inevitably repeat the whole assignment if you don't do the backup which can take hours to complete.
